        <h2>FORMULA-1</h2>
        <p>
            A garden is a piece of land that is usually close to a house, used for growing vegetables, fruits, flowers, ornamental shrubs, or trees. Gardens can be large or small, and they can be formal or informal. A formal garden is typically laid out in a symmetrical pattern, with straight lines and geometric shapes. An informal garden is more relaxed and natural, with winding paths and curves.
    There are many reasons why people love gardens. Some people enjoy the beauty of flowers and plants. Others enjoy the challenge of growing their own food. Still others find gardening to be a relaxing and therapeutic activity.
    Gardens can provide a number of benefits, both physical and mental. Gardening can help people to get exercise, eat healthier, and reduce stress. It can also help people to connect with nature and learn more about plants.
    If you are thinking about starting a garden, there are a few things you need to do first. You need to choose a location for your garden that gets plenty of sunlight and has good drainage. You also need to decide what type of plants you want to grow. Once you have chosen your plants, you need to prepare the soil and plant them. You will also need to water your plants regularly and fertilize them as needed.
    With a little care and attention, your garden can be a beautiful and rewarding addition to your home <br><br>
    While there are many plants growing in the wild, people also cultivate and grow certain plants, bushes and shrubs in their homes or yards. This activity is known as gardening. While it may appear as a hobby to some, the fact is that gardening is actually quite beneficial and, therefore, important to us.
    
    Gardening is a fairly physical activity. It involves weeding, watering of plants, mulching, trellising and harvesting – all of which require physical labour from the gardener. Hence, it becomes an excellent addition to your exercise routine.
    Gardening is also a very practical activity. It allows you to grow your own vegetables and fruits thus ensuring that you have healthy food on the table. When you harvest vegetables from your garden, you do so knowing that you’re getting the freshest produce possible.
    Gardening for aesthetics appeals to the human need for beauty. Ornamental gardening caters to the side of us that is delighted by beauty. In addition, flowers are a part and parcel of most occasions such as births, anniversaries, weddings, birthdays and funerals.
    Gardening also helps sharpen problem solving skills. Researching the best methods to make your garden grow, experimenting with different techniques and designing irrigation systems that work for you all help in improving your skills at creativity, problem solving and planni
